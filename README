Is It Luck? - Interactive Data Visualization
An interactive data visualization project that explores infant mortality rates across different demographics in the United States through an engaging scrollytelling experience.

Project Overview: This project combines poetry with data visualization to tell a story about infant mortality disparities across socioeconomic and racial demographics. The visualization moves through several "keyframes" that highlight different aspects of these disparities as the user progresses through the poem.
