													<li><p>Manmade geographic boundaries and their names are not static. Substantial changes to county or county equivalent entities that affect these data during a particular decade may be found on the Census website at <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/county-changes.html">Changes to Counties and County Equivalent Entities: 1970-Present (census.gov)</a>. Data comparisons in these areas should be conducted with these changes in mind.</p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>
